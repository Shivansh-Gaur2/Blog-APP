# Blog-APP
This Blog Application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), implements secure user authentication with bcrypt for password hashing and JWT tokens for session management. The app is designed following the MVC architecture on the backend and best practices on the frontend for scalability and maintainability. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, manage profiles, and engage with other users through a commenting system. Data is stored using MongoDB with Mongoose to manage schemas and validation. I created two models in Mongoose: one for User, which handles user data like usernames, email, and hashed passwords, and another for Blog, which stores post details such as title, content, and timestamps. These models are linked through a reference (ref) in the Blog model, where each post is associated with a user by storing the userâ€™s ObjectId. This allows efficient retrieval of user-specific posts or fetching author details for each blog post. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
